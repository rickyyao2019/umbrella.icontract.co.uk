Contracting - Financial Matters
===

So you’ve decided you’re ready to turn your skills and experience into a
successful contracting career. At first it sounded too easy – more money,
more flexibility, more control. But then you realised the pay-off was having
to figure out things like tax, pensions and insurance all on your own.

Many first-time contractors hit the ground running, only to find the
administration of working for themselves all too much. By taking the time to
plan out how you will operate, how you will structure your income for tax
purposes, as well as which insurance and pension plan is right for you, you
can focus on your contracting projects, rather than being tied up in the nitty
gritty of your accounts.

The team at iContract remember being where you are now, all set to embark
on a contracting career, only to be baffled and quite frankly a little
frightened, by all the financial jargon that goes into running your own shop.
In this easy-to-digest guidebook, we draw on our experience and share the
most up-to-date information on tax, mortgages, pensions and insurance, so
there are no nasty surprises when you head out on your own.

## Limited company or Umbrella company?

![](/contractor-resources/img/limited-company-or-umbrella-company.png 'Limited company or Umbrella company')
You may never have imagined yourself as an all-powerful company director.
But if you set yourself up as a contractor under your own company, that’s
exactly what you will be.

There are lots of reasons why it’s a good idea for contractors to present
themselves as a company and many people choose to set one up when they
set out on their own.

The protective layer of a limited company brings security to freelancers and
contractors. The company becomes liable for its own debts, PAYE payments
can be set up for more straightforward tax payments, and your overall tax bill
can even work out much less than it would otherwise be, thanks to the legal
advantages of setting up a limited company.

Limited companies offer a great framework for contractors, but they also
come with responsibilities and for that reason some people choose a more
service-heavy solution.

Umbrella companies are companies that are set up and run by a limited
company separate from the contractors who trade under its name.
Contractors pay to belong to an umbrella company, and in return invoice
and get paid under that company name, administered by somebody else
who makes sure you have all the legal bases covered.

It costs more for the umbrella company’s service, but for some contractors,
relieving themselves of the administrative burden is worth every cent.
So which should you choose? This might give you a clearer picture of the
pros and cons to help you decide:

### Umbrella Company

**Advantages**
- All legal, tax and financial stuff handled for you
- Same legal protection
- Ideal for those testing the water with contracting
- No company admin or invoicing hassle
- Some of the umbrella companies especially when set up PAYE through your
  recruitment agencies provide paid annual holidays (i.e. 5 days per year).
  It’s worth checking with your recruitment agent.

**Disadvantages**
- Umbrella companies take a small % cut from your income, although it is
  treated as expenses which is tax deductive
- Some tax saving, but less than that with a limited company
- Slightly less flexibility
- No overall control of the company

It’s up to you how you choose to structure your arrangements as a
contractor. Those who are new to contracting and don’t have experience
running a business, or who are unsure about whether they’ll still be
contracting in a year’s time are good candidates for an umbrella company
option. There’s also no reason why you can’t start with an umbrella
company and move over to your own limited company later, when
you are more established Umbrella companies will typically charge a monthly fee,
often on a sliding scale depending on the level of service you choose. Finding a
good umbrella company setup can be a great time, stress and hassle-saver, but it is
important to make sure you’re getting value for money, especially in the
early days of your contracting career.

Accountancy, tax and legal compliance are amongst some of the trickiest
aspects of working as a contractor. Umbrella companies can handle some
of this for you, as can your accountant. But a savvy contractor will not just
hand the umbrella company their business blindly. Make sure you read the
other chapters in this guidebook to ensure you’re always one step ahead,
regardless of who is managing your taxes.

### Limited Company

**Advantages**
- Invoicing, earnings and payment flexibility
- Legal protection from limited liability structure
- Freedom to take on different types of work
- No income deduction taken from umbrella companies

**Disadvantages**
The contractor (i.e. you) is responsible for:
- Company admin: record income, expenses and VAT
- Manage and filing accounts: calculate and ensure you are paying the correct
  corporate and personal taxes
- No holiday payment

A limited company structure puts you in control of the finances including
how your income is distributed and how much of your business expenditure
you can claim each financial year. Due to the flexibility of this option,
contractors can see tax savings when they manage their company well. But
that management takes time and requires more accounting skills and legal
knowledge than you may have realised. A limited company is required to file
its annual report, audited by a professional accountant, on an annual basis. It
is therefore vitally important to choose a good accountant or accountancy
firm who can provide you the right advice and help you manage the process.

Of course, accountants tend to charge by the minute, so we understand you
don’t want to run to your accountant for every little question. As a director of
a limited company, it is important that you understand the tax requirements
and financial planning yourself. To guide you through this new and
confusing world, iContract has pulled together an essential guide to
accountancy and tax for contractors.

## Accountancy and tax advice for contractors

![](/contractor-resources/img/accountancy-and-tax-advice-for-contractors.png 'Accountancy and tax advice for contractors')
Ask any contractor what they find easiest about their job and few, if any, will
say it’s tax. Accounting, record keeping, filing for and paying taxes can be
both the most mind-boggling and boring aspect of the job.

Getting the right advice is really important, because you want to be sure you
are always staying on the right side of the law. Get it wrong, and you could
end up paying a hefty price in fines, fees and interest. In some cases, you
might even end up with a criminal conviction.

Yes, accountancy and tax is serious and necessary, but it can also bring you
great benefits. Organising your affairs in the most tax-efficient way can bring
you significantly greater savings and more money straight to your pocket.
The first step to handling your financial obligations as a contractor is to
understand which taxes you need to pay.

### Which taxes should you pay?

#### Income Tax/NI
Contractors need to pay income tax on any money they earn. For those
without a limited company, or an umbrella company in place, this will
usually be through a self assessment. That means completing a tax return
every year, documenting your earnings and allowable expenses. Your tax is
calculated as a percentage of what’s left. This information must be submitted
to HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs) in a timely, accurate way –
unless you are paid via the PAYE (pay-as-you-earn) system, in which case
your employer must submit the relevant information for you.

Umbrella companies pay via PAYE, which means you are essentially treated
like an employee. Unless you also take dividends from your company, you
may not need to complete a self assessment return.

#### VAT
Contractors who bill work in excess of a certain threshold are legally
required to collect VAT (value-added tax) on behalf of the exchequer,
adding a percentage on to the total cost of any work commissioned and
remitting forward to HMRC on a monthly or quarterly basis. You are liable
for adding VAT costs to your total invoice amount and for making payments
to HMRC accordingly.

VAT registered contractors and companies benefit from being able to
reclaim VAT on purchases, which means spending on VAT applicable
goods and services is cheaper for VAT registered contractors than
non-registered contractors.

Contractors can obtain further savings by registering for the VAT flat scheme,
which allows small businesses to charge VAT based on a 20% rate, but to pay
HMRC a reduced rate if they opt out of claiming VAT on purchases. To be
eligible for the VAT flat scheme, you must be VAT-registered and expect an
annual turnover of £150,000 or less. The flat rate contractors pay depends
on the type of business they run. The flat rate for management consultants
is 14%. You can view a full list of VAT rates for different industries here:
https://www.gov.uk/vat-flat-rate-scheme/how-much-you-pay

The pitfall of the VAT flat scheme is that you are no longer able to reclaim
VAT on purchases. However, for contractors who do not purchase
equipment and services on a frequent basis, the flat scheme can still be the
best option because of the substantial tax savings. One further benefit of
registering for the VAT flat scheme is you are entitled to a further 1% discount
in the first year of operation, reducing effective VAT rate you pay to 13%.

#### Corporation Tax
Corporation tax is the tax a company must pay on its profits. As a contractor
who sets up a limited company, you will have to pay corporation tax.

### Tax planning tips tor any contractor
Being a contractor means you can plan your tax affairs. An employee is paid
and taxed through PAYE, so the tax is automatically calculated and deducted
from your pay cheque. A contractor, on the other hand, is responsible for
calculating and managing his own corporate tax. Your company’s business
expenses need to be deducted against your revenue to calculate your net
profit. The corporate tax you pay is then calculated based on your net profit,
rather than your revenue. The corporate tax rate in the UK is currently 20%.
The trick is to offset your business expenses against your income to reduce
your total tax bill and to give you the flexibility to manage your own takings
through dividends and salary.

#### Dividends vs. Salary
There are two main ways you can choose to be paid by your company. As
a director/employee, you can take a salary, paid through PAYE and taxed
accordingly. But as a shareholder, you can also take dividends – a share of
profits, to which you are entitled as the 100% owner. In the end, both salary
and dividends are cash in your bank account, but the tax implication
between the two is different.

#### Salary tax rate
Salary is taxed at the prevailing income tax rate based on your tax band.
The table below shows the personal tax rate for tax year 6 April 2016 to
5 April 2017.

Band               | Taxable income     | Tax rat
---                | ---                | ---
Personal Allowance | Up to £11,000      | 0%
Basic Rate         | £11,000 to £43,000 | 20%
Higher Rate        | £43,001 to £150,00 | 40%
Additional Rate    | Over £150,000      | 45%

The personal allowance for tax year 6 April 2016 to 5 April 2017 is £11,000.
The personal allowances and tax rates are adjusted on an annual basis.
Make sure you regularly check the new rates at: https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates

#### Dividend tax rate
Prior to 6 April 2016, dividend tax rates were based on total dividend amount
and not associated with your total income. However, from 6 April 2016
onwards, dividends are taxed based on your income band, where your total
income includes your salary and dividends. The first £5000 in dividends are
tax-free and are not included in the below calculation.

Band                            | Total income (salary + dividends) | Tax rat
---                             | ---                               | ---
Basic Rate (and non-tax payers) | Up to £43,000                     | 7.5%
Higher Rate                     | £43,001 to £150,000               | 32.5%
Additional Rate                 | Over £150,000                     | 38.1%

### How much should I take out as salary vs. dividends?
Historically, this has been an easy answer. Take the minimum salary level
under the income tax personal allowance and take the rest in dividends.
This is because dividends were taxed at a lower rate than income tax, so
you could effectively reduce your tax bill by allocating as much of the
income to dividends as possible.

However, the recent change in dividend tax rules changes things and has
closed the gap between salary and dividend rates.

**Here are some examples to illustrate this:**

#### John is on a contract with a contract rate of £500 per day. He worked 200 days in total from April 2016.

    Total Revenue        = £500 x 200 = £100,000
    Business Expenditure = £20,000
    Net profit           = £80,000
    Corporate tax rate @ 20% of £80,000 = £16,000 (although salary is tax
    deductive, but here we assume you save £16,000 in the account to pay future
    corporate tax on a conservative basis)
    Remaining cash in the bank after corporate tax = £80,000 - £16,000
    **Total = £64,000**

#### Scenario 1
John wants to take out £50,000 in total from a combination of salary and
dividends and leaves the remaining £14,000 in the business as the retained
earnings. Salary is paid on a monthly basis while dividends can be taken out
any time of the year.

To take out his personal allowance of £11,000 as salary only
and the rest as dividends.

    Salary = £11,000 (monthly salary £917)
    No income tax payable Dividends = £39,000

The first £32k is subject to a basic dividend rate of 7.5%. John can use his £5k
dividend allowance to offset the lower threshold dividend tax. The remaining £7k
is taxed at a higher dividend rate of 32.5%. Therefore the dividend tax John
pays = (£32,000-£5,000) x 7.5% + £7,000 x 32.5% = £4,300.

**Can John reduce his tax bill by using a different combination of salary
and dividends?**

#### Scenario 2
Now let’s assume John takes out £43,000 salary and £7,000 dividends.

    Salary       = £43,000 (monthly salary £3,583)
    Income Tax   = (£43,000 - £11,000) x 20% = £6,400
    Dividends    = £7,000
    Dividend tax = (£7,000 - £5000) x 32.5% = £650
    His tax bill in this case will be made up of income tax of £6,400
    and dividend tax of £650, with a total tax bill of £7,050.

However, salary is subject to national insurance contributions, while dividends
are not (we will cover the national insurance contribution in part 2). This adds
on additional costs for taking out salary.

The new rule indeed closes the gap between total tax paid using different salary
and dividend combinations, and the best option for calculating a contractor’s
tax is not always immediately obvious.

In order to plan your tax efficiently, you will need to consider your earnings
as a combination of salary and dividends, which tax band that will put you
under, and to run through several scenarios to calculate which combination best
benefits you.

**Is there any way you can plan ahead to reduce your effective tax rate,
you ask?**

Well, yes. Adjusting the total cash you would like to take out from the
business instead, can put you into a different tax bracket and reduce your
effective tax rate significantly. The magic number is the basic rate bracket
of £43,000!

#### Scenario 3
For example, in view of the high tax rates, John might decide he needs to
instead take out £43,000 to keep himself within the basic rate category. He
can keep more cash in the company, which can be used for investments and
business purchases in the following years.

The most efficient way to take £43,000 is to fully utilise both the £11,000
personal allowances on the income tax and the £5000 tax-free dividend.

    Salary       = £11,000 (monthly salary £917).
    Tax          = No income tax payable.
    Dividends    = £32,000
    Tax          = Since John’s total income is £43,000, he falls under the basic dividend rate of 7.5%.
    Dividend tax = (£32,000 - £5000) x 7.5% = £2,025

Therefore, in taking £43,000, the total tax John will owe will be £2,025 only,
an effective tax rate of just 4.7%. By reducing the total cash he takes out of
the business by £7k, John can reduce his effective tax rate significantly.

Although every contractor has to consider his own personal circumstances
when deciding how much he would like to earn from the business, in order
to reduce the tax bill, it is more beneficial for a contractor to keep the total
income under £43,000 per year and to take a combination of salary and
dividends to fully utilise both personal allowances and free dividend amount
to minimise the total effective tax rate.

One thing to note though is salary is tax deductive while dividends are not.
Therefore, by taking a smaller salary, your corporate tax will increase. The
best structure is probably to take a salary more than £11,000, and the rest in
dividends, keeping the total income at £43,000. The optimal level will depend on
your business expenditures. If you know your ongoing business expenditures, then
your accountant should be able to work out the magic combination!

### National Insurance Contribution
One further item to add into your total calculation is national insurance
contribution. If you are an employee of the company on PAYE, both the
employer and you need to pay a national insurance contribution. Dividends,
on the other hand, are not subject to national insurance contributions.

So as an employee of your company, you also need to pay national
insurance, and you should deduct this from your pay cheque before salaries
are paid.

Any salary-earner above the primary threshold of £672 per month or £8,064
per year, is obliged to pay a national insurance contribution. A slightly higher
secondary threshold of £676 per month or £8,112 per year is used as a
starting point for employers to pay their national insurance contribution.
National insurance contributions are physically paid by employers but the
majority comes from the employee’s earnings and is paid through direct
salary deductions. The employers pay 13.8% of the total income above the
secondary threshold level, while 12% of the total income above the primary
threshold is paid by employees through direct salary deductions. However,
as a contractor who owns 100% of your company and only has yourself as
the PAYE salary-earner, it does not make much difference who pays the bill
(employer or employee). National Insurance Contributions are capped at an
upper earning limit of £43,008. Any salary above £43,008 is not subject to
national insurance contributions.

**Now let’s look at John’s income again in the above example.**

#### In scenario 1, John takes out a salary of £11,000.

    National Insurance contribution paid by John
      = (£11,000 - £ 8,064) x 12% = £352
    National Insurance contribution paid by John’s company
      = (£11,000 - £ 8,112) x 13.8% = £399
    Therefore, John’s company collects £352 from John
    and pays a total of £399. For John as a single contractor
    with a limited company structure, his total costs are £399.
    His total tax bill including national insurance contribution
    is £4,300 + £399 = £4,699

#### In scenario 2, John takes out a salary of £43,000.

    National Insurance contribution paid by John = (£43,000 - £ 8,064) x 12% = £4,192
    National Insurance contribution paid by John’s company = (£43,000 - £ 8,112) x 13.8% = £4,815
    His total tax bill including national insurance contribution is £7,050 + £4,815 = £11,865

Therefore, when we add national insurance contributions into the tax
equation, taking out dividends is much more cost effective than salary.

#### In Scenario 3, the salary is £11,000 again,

so the national insurance contribution is £398.54. The total tax bill including
the national insurance contribution is £2,025 + 399 = £2,424.

Most self-employed people pay National Insurance through Self Assessment.

Some self-employed people don’t pay National Insurance through Self Assessment,
but may want to pay voluntary contributions. These are:
- examiners, moderators, invigilators and people who set exam questions.
- people who run businesses involving land or property.
- ministers of religion who don’t receive a salary or stipend.
- people who make investments for themselves or others - but not as a
business and without getting a fee or commission.

However, for majority of contractors, we are liable to pay national insurance on
our salary through self-assessment. Therefore. It’s not difficult to see taking
out a low salary and high dividends while keeping your total income at £43,000
is still the ultimate combination. Again the exact combination depends on your
business expenditures and your corporate tax. Always checks with your accountant
if you are not sure!

### Legitimate expenses
Businesses incur expenses in the course of trading. As a contractor, you are
no different. Equipment, resources and materials and other types of
work-specific expense are deductible from your income. This can reduce the
overall amount of money you need to pay corporate tax on, as corporate tax
is based on net profit, not revenue.

Those paid through PAYE aren’t able to do this and need to take the hit on
anything they personally spend concerning their job or working life. But as
a contractor, you can claim expenditures directly in the course of your
trade through your limited company. This includes business travel, training,
insurance, phone costs, IT, advertising and even a share of household bills if
you spend a proportion of your time working from home. Make sure that
the expenses you claim are directly related to your business, for example
travel to a client site or client meetings are legitimate, but personal holiday
is not. You can set a daily allowance for lunch when you are on a client’s
site but dinner with colleagues for leisure is not a legitimate expense. When
you are in doubt, ask yourself, “does the activity this expenditure is
associated with help my business function?” Sometimes you can claim part
of the expenditure if it is partly business partly personal, but the proportion
needs to be determined in a measurable way. If you are not sure, check
with your accountant to make sure the amount and proportion you claim is
legitimate before you put these claims through.

### Tax payment schedule
Different taxes have different payment schedules and timeframes and, as
a contractor, you need to know when these are so you can be prepared.
These payment dates depend on your incorporation date, accounting
period and VAT registration date. The following example outlines when you
need to pay taxes due, based on an incorporation date of 1st Jan 2015, an
accounting year end 31 Dec and a VAT registration date of 1st Jan 2015.

Tax                | Filing date              | Payment date
---                | ---                      | ---
Corporation Tax    | 31st Dec 2015            | 31st Dec 2015
VAT Monthly        | 7th Apr 2015–7th         | Jan 2016
VAT Quarterly      | 7th May, 7th Aug         | 7th Nov 2015
Personal Tax 2015  | April 2014 to April 2015 | 31st Jan 2016
Personal Tax 2017  | April 2015 to April 2016 | 31st Jan 2017

## Mortgage Guide

![](/contractor-resources/img/mortgage-guide.png 'Mortgage guide')
One of the biggest concerns for contractors is securing credit and in
particular, applying for a mortgage.

Mortgage applications are less straightforward for contractors than for
employees, who can evidence a steady, stable income. As a contractor,
you may need to provide more information to verify your income and to
convince the mortgage lender of your credit stability.

Here are our top tips for ensuring you can still apply for a mortgage,
regardless of your employment status:

### Decide how much you can borrow
The amount you can borrow is related to your income and can be calculated
using an online mortgage calculator. Provide a realistic measure of your
annual earnings – don’t overestimate the amount you can borrow, or try to
be too ambitious about the size of mortgage you are looking for. Banks
aren’t willing to lend money to those they don’t think can afford it, so make
sure you have reasonable expectations about the amount of money you
could borrow.

Halifax allows you to use your day rate to calculate an annual income as
long as you have been contracting in the same industry for several years and
plan to continue doing so.

Most banks will need at least 2 or 3 years’ worth of accounts to assess your
income level. If you are just starting out contracting, the truth is, it will be
very difficult to get a mortgage. Whilst minimising your salary will help
reduce your tax liabilities, your mortgage eligibility will be tested based on
your income level. So think ahead and balance the two out!

### Stress test your application
This step is often overlooked, but is essential for contractors looking to take
out a mortgage. Interest rates can jump about over the course of your
mortgage, causing you to have to pay more or less in mortgage interest,
depending on the type of mortgage agreement you have in place.

With interest rates of up to 5%, can you still afford your mortgage payments?
While interest rates remain at historically low levels now, there are no
guarantees this will always be the case. By applying different scenarios to
your calculations, you can work out whether you could continue to afford
your mortgage throughout the duration of your repayment term.

### Tidy up your credit profile
Your credit profile and overall credit score are used as important gauges of
your creditworthiness. As a contractor, you simply can’t afford to be applying
for a mortgage with black marks on your record and you need to fix any
issues with your credit profile before applying.

Remember that searches on your credit profile will themselves be visible to
other lenders and too many applications in a short period of time can
damage your perceived creditworthiness. Make sure you are paying debt off
and that you are making repayments on time across the board. A low credit
score coupled with your self-employed or contractor employment status is
likely to make it difficult to secure the mortgage you need.

### Gather appropriate documentation
Banks and other lenders need to see documentation to support your
application. For most, this would be in the form of identification cards and
passports, payslips and perhaps bank statements. For contractors, you may
also have to show accounts, CV, contracts or other financial records proving
your income over a period of time that will convince the lender of your
ability to meet long term repayments.

A copy of any contracts you currently have will be helpful, demonstrating
the amount and frequency of your pay. Make sure all your documentation is
in order and you have all the paperwork you need ahead of your application
– this will make it easier and less time-consuming to complete the process
of applying for your mortgage.

### Save for your deposit
Having a sizeable deposit reduces the amount you need to borrow,
convinces the lender you will be more likely to repay and provides additional
security behind your application from the get-go.

Thanks to government schemes, it is possible to take your first steps on the
housing ladder with as little as a 5% deposit on the value of your mortgage.
But the more you can contribute up front, the easier you will find it to secure
the mortgage you need. Make a concerted effort to save for a house before
jumping into an application – it’s always in your interests to have a bigger
deposit to play with.

### Check your expenses
Due to the new mortgage regulations imposed last year, all lenders are
required to carry out affordability tests on mortgage applicants. This means
your income is not the only criteria, as lenders assess your regular outgoings
and use the remaining income (income minus regular expenses) to
determine your affordability.

Lenders ask for 3 to 6 months’ worth of bank statements as evidence of your
regular outgoings and to prove what you have stated in your application. So
make sure you plan ahead and rack up a sensible spending record before
you make an application.

### Remember the tax factor
Remember that there is tax to pay when you buy a home, in the form of
stamp duty. The stamp duty land tax threshold is £125,000 for primary
residential properties for tax year April 2016. This means that you have to pay
a stamp duty ranging from 1% to 7% of the purchase price for any properties
valued at more than £125,000. From 6th April 2016, all buy-to-let properties
are liable to pay a stamp duty.

Whether you are looking to buy your first home or to use your contractor
income to invest in buy-to-let, make sure you add the stamp duty to your
cost base. Think about how much you might have to pay in stamp duty and
make sure you know the threshold at which this tax kicks in. It could end up
saving you thousands of pounds, or in the worst-case scenario, leaving you
with an unexpected tax bill you might struggle to afford.

### Other top tips for securing your mortgage

- **Look for specialist mortgage brokers**, and contractor-focused deals.  These do
  exist and can be based on annualised contract rates, or even multiples of
  your day rate in some cases. For example, Halifax offers contractor mortgages
  based on a multiple of your daily rate, with no need to file accounts or tax
  returns and without the lengthy and complicated mortgage application for
  contractors. It’s worth checking it out.
- **Freelancers, and those with multiple clients**, should aim to secure a retainer
  from at least one client. Some banks and other lenders have the flexibility
  to look more creatively at your financial position, which can lead to a
  better chance of securing the mortgage you want.
- **Consider interest-only options**. These provide lower monthly costs, with the
  ability to repay capital when it is convenient to do so – the perfect setup
  for contractors. However, with tightening FSA/FCA regulation around these
  types of loans, they may become less common.
- **Don’t rush in feet-first.** Don’t rush in to buying a property because you feel
  you have to – you may well end up prejudicing your monthly financial position
  and feeling undue amounts of stress as a result.

## Prepare for the future – your pension

![](/contractor-resources/img/prepare-for-the-future-your-pension.png 'Prepare for your future - your pension')
When you make the decision to become a contractor, you are foregoing
many of the benefits associated with a full-time job. One of these is a
company pension and it’s becoming an increasingly important feature of
modern life to help provide for retirement.

With an aging population, setting aside money as a pension pot is crucial for
you to live comfortably in your senior years. While it might seem like a long
way off, the last thing you want is to be struggling to afford a roof above
your head when you are elderly, all because you didn’t plan ahead.

### You need pension provision
Anyone who works a full-time job will more than likely be enrolled in a
pension plan, often organised and provided by their employer. These plans
take payments over a working lifetime, invest the capital and return the
applicable amount in chunks once the qualifying terms have been met.

As a contractor, you can’t rely on working to put food on the table until the
day you die. That means you need to set money aside as quickly and as
diligently as possible for your future, so you have as much money as
possible to live on when your income streams finally stop.

Everyone needs to think about their pension provision, but it’s even more
important for those under their own employment, like contractors and
taking the right steps now can set you up with a more comfortable pension
for later life, with the added benefit of saving tax in the process.

### Save tax whilst providing for your future
Paying into a pension fund is tax deductible, so contractors who choose
to do so now can save money today on their income for tomorrow.

The government wants people to provide for their own pensions and
encourages this through deferring applicable taxes. This means that there is
a financial incentive for contractors and freelancers to save money for their
pensions as soon as possible, to reduce their tax liability, whilst feathering
their nest for the future

### State pension for contractors
Contractors are in a tricky position when it comes to the state pension, with
many unable to claim the full amount due to them as a result of interrupted
National Insurance payments.

Contractors often choose to pay themselves a smaller salary so they can
avoid National Insurance payments. This is good in the sense of saving on
your tax bill in the short term, but means that the state pension entitlement
you receive will be proportionately less. As a result, many contractors
choose to pay into a private plan, as the main source of their income
beyond retirement.

### Choosing your pension plan – personal/stakeholder or executive
Since changes to tax law (IR35 in particular), pensions remain one of the
major tax breaks still available to those working as contractors and you’ll
want to make sure you take advantage of them.

There are two main types of pension plans you will likely choose from:

#### Personal/stakeholder pensions
This is the most common type of pension plan you will encounter and one
that pretty much anyone can take out. Provider charges and fees are capped
at 1% and payments of up to £300 per month can be made before there are
any further tax complications.

A major advantage for contractors choosing stakeholder pensions is that
they can nominate a base year of earnings from any of the past 5 years. You
can then nominate your highest grossing year as your base year and pay
more into your pension than would otherwise be the case.

#### Executive pensions
The other major type of pension you are likely to encounter is the executive
pension plan, which is offered to those running businesses who have
previously neglected pension planning and instead focused on building their
business. The calculations used for working out how much you can pay in to
an executive pension plan are different from those used in personal plans, so
you may be able to pay in more each month than would otherwise be
permitted.

### Other issues to consider when thinking about your pension

- **How many years stand between now and when you wish to retire?** The longer
  there is between when you start building up resources for retirement and when
  you need to start drawing an income, the more time the investment will have
  to grow.
- **Which investment vehicle will you use?** Examples include stocks, bonds, ISAs,
  property and cash and each has its advantages and disadvantages, including;
  accessibility, risk, tax treatment and cost, so it’s worth doing your
  homework.
- **How much of your income is available to invest towards retirement planning?**
  In most cases, in order to build up sufficient capital, a significant
  percentage of income has to be set aside to meet this objective. However,
  there is little point in concentrating on retirement planning at the expense
  of other priorities. As with most things in life, it is a matter of balance
  and compromise.
- **What income do you require in retirement?** This is one of the most important
  aspects of retirement planning and also one of the hardest to establish. It
  is usually a considerable number of years away and involves a lifestyle that
  it is difficult to envision at a younger age. There are also a number of
  variables outside your control that can impact the situation, such as
  inflation, levels of state support, investment returns and so on.
- **Nevertheless, it is vital to set an income objective at the outset and revise
  this as time passes**. A useful starting point may be to look at your current
  outgoings and decide which will continue into retirement, which will cease
  (e.g. mortgage repayments) and which ones you may need to add in as you get
  older, e.g. higher health care expenditure.

#### The State Pension
Alongside occupational pensions, contractors can expect to benefit from
state support, in the form of the Basic State Pension and the State Second
Pension (S2P). The amount payable varies depending on contributions to
National Insurance.

The majority of contractors will be entitled to the maximum Basic State
Pension, which is maxed at £119.30 per week for tax year 2016/2017.
The S2P was scrapped in 2012/13, apart from for Final Salary Schemes,
where S2P remains for the time being. This was based on the individual’s
record of NI contributions and their income level. S2P benefits accrued up
until 6 April 2012 are still protected and will still be paid on retirement.

#### Annual Allowance
Paying into a pension scheme can be hugely tax efficient for contractors.
Contributions of up to £40,000 per annum can be made without further
taxation, with any amounts over and above this subject to measures to
recoup marginal tax relief.

In some circumstances, it is possible to ‘carry forward’ unused Annual
Allowance amounts from previous years. This means in better years, you
can set aside a greater proportion of your income up to the maximum of
£160,000 over 4 years, in order to maximise relief and the overall savings
to tax.

The Lifetime Allowance is £1 million from the 2016/17 tax year and tax
relief is available on contributions at the marginal rate of tax applicable
for the individual.

Pensions can quickly become a challenging subject, especially for
contractors with no formal legal or financial background. As a result,
many contractors choose to seek professional advice on these issues.

## Professional and Health Insurance

![](/contractor-resources/img/professional-and-health-insurance.png 'Professional and Health Insurance')
Insurance is another area contractors need to think about. As a sole
contractor, you are your business – without you, you can’t earn money.
That means any period of illness or absence comes at your own expense,
unless provision is in place. It means that you are liable for damages if
anything goes wrong and this financial responsibility is enough to land even
a successful contractor in hot water.

Insurance is one of those business expenses many contractors feel they can
do without. But on both a professional and personal level, having the right
type and extent of cover in place is key to maintaining peace of mind,
whatever happens in the future.

As a contractor, you will be legally required to have some form of insurance
in place. The most common are set out below.

### Professional Insurance
Professional indemnity insurance
covers the integrity of your work as a professional contractor and provides
for negligence resulting in damages to your employer or client. PIL covers
your back in the event you are sued for negligence, error or omission in the
course of your work.

#### Public liability insurance
is available to cover your liability in many circumstances – such as liability to
employees, to members of the public and to your clients. Make sure the
value of insurance cover you are taking out is enough to protect you.

Professional indemnity and public liability insurance are usually compulsory
for contractors if you carry out any work for an established company
before the contract starts. Depending on the employer, the amount you are
required to insure may differ, although commonly, the minimum coverage
level for both is £1m.

#### Business property insurance
protects you against damages to any premises you operate from and
ensures the assets of your business are covered against any possible losses.

#### Income protection
policies provide coverage against losses to your income as a result of illness,
accident, or some other insured basis. This type of insurance pays out when
you are otherwise unable to earn money, provided the reason for your
absence is covered by the policy. This is a lifeline for many contractors,
who are just as susceptible as anyone else to injury or periods of absence.

### Health Insurance
For some contractors, health and medical insurance is important – both
for safeguarding their own wellbeing and for covering the medical costs
of others that you may become liable for through the course of the work
you do.

With all types of insurance, you will be charged a premium and usually this
can be paid at monthly intervals to keep your cover active.

Failure to make payments on your insurance will leave you without the cover
you anticipate. This is playing with fire and you may even find it difficult to
obtain further coverage in future when the time comes for renewal.

Whether its health insurance for yourself or others, or simply general liability
insurance for your contracting work, make sure you are up-to-date with
your premiums to stay safely covered at all times.

#### What to look for when buying insurance
Insurance is often seen as a commodity cost – the cheapest provider wins.

But not all insurance policies and providers are the same. In fact, different
policies will have radically different terms of cover, exclusions and
conditions. You need to be fully aware of the exact scope of your cover
before committing to one provider – the cheapest isn’t always the best.
The last thing you want, in the event of a crisis, is to think you are insured,
only to find your cover doesn’t extend as far as you thought.

#### When buying insurance of any kind, you need to be sure:
- you have the coverage you need
- you know the exclusions and exemptions from cover
- you can afford to pay the premiums
- you are aware of any excess, or other clauses that may affect your rights
- you have read the policy document and you understand what you have
bought

Buying insurance can be tricky, especially for those new to contracting. Yet it
can be the difference between trading safely with the protection you need to
weather any storm and playing with fire in the hope that you will never fall
victim to any potential business disaster.

As a contractor, your sole source of income depends on your ability to
fifind and perform work. Without insurance, you are gambling against your
livelihood – a far from ideal situation for those with families and other
commitments.

Don’t rush in to buying insurance and feel free to speak to an independent
financial advisor if you feel you would benefit from a further discussion
about your options. It’s well worth getting the right cover in place as soon
as possible, so you can rest easy in the knowledge that you’re protected.
Contracting might sound like living the dream – dictating your own hours,
rates and projects – but working for yourself also means navigating the
worlds of tax, insurance, pensions and mortgages on your own. For those
who have always worked as a full-time member of an organisation’s staff,
where the accounts and HR teams took care of everything for you, it can be
extremely daunting to tackle on your own.

Your team at iContract is always on hand to guide you through the process
of financial management for your contracting business. We have access to
experts across all aspects of financial planning for contracting and are
